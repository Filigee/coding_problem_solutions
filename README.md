# Codewars Challenges
This is a repository filled with my Codewars challenges that I do daily, they're divided into different subfolders based on their Kata level. I try to push atleast one solution daily, most days I'll end up getting in the zone and pushing a few more though! 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Different coding challenges that are created by users in the Codewars community, solutions are tested against different cases and if they don't pass every test then are deemed to have failed.

## Optimizations

I will always go back to challenges that I couldn't complete the first time and try to complete them again with a fresh mental state. I also go back to refactor my code for efficiency and readability.

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I've learned from Codewars is that I still have a lot to learn, but I will keep trying everyday.
